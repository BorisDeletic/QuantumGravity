POLYCHORD:
NLive is resolution of parameter space (theta)
what is the map Hypercube -> Theta? Why do we need it.
What if we have distinct classes of Theta e.g. (Field value, Triangulation configuration).
What is ndead, posteriors?

--- Scaling with dimension ---
Assume we have fast likelihood calls.
How does (Nlive, Nrepeats, phantoms, posteriors, equals) scale with dimension?
How does slice sampling scale with dimension? Do we have to sample all Theta_i each iteration?
How does clustering scale with dimension?
How well is topological freezing handled with increasing dimension, e.g. Ising model.
How does autocorrelation in the markov chain scale with dimension compared to HMC?
