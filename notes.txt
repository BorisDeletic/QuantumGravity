POLYCHORD:
NLive is resolution of parameter space (theta)
what is the map Hypercube -> Theta? Why do we need it.
What if we have distinct classes of Theta e.g. (Field value, Triangulation configuration).
What is ndead, posteriors?

--- Scaling with dimension ---
Assume we have fast likelihood calls.
How does (Nlive, Nrepeats, phantoms, posteriors, equals) scale with dimension?
How does slice sampling scale with dimension? Do we have to sample all Theta_i each iteration?
How does clustering scale with dimension?
How well is topological freezing handled with increasing dimension, e.g. Ising model.
How does autocorrelation in the markov chain scale with dimension compared to HMC?


GPU ising - https://github.com/NVIDIA/ising-gpu

CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) - 1+1, 1+2,
EDT (euclidean dynamical triangulations) - Tim Budd


Things to explore:
Confinement in the Schwinger model
Non flat spacetime lattices
Fermion vs Boson fields

Phi to the four with Nested Sampling
CDT with nested sampling

Gradient implementation for nested sampling (HMC)
Using nested sampling for coarse grained sampling.
Termination parameter.

-----------
Plan:
Nested Sampling with Ising Model - then phi to the four - eventually gravity.

-----------
Lots of potential changes to improve NS as an alternative to MCMC.
