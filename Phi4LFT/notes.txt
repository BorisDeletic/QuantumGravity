Things to explore:
Confinement in the Schwinger model
Non flat spacetime lattices
Phi to the four LFT with Nested Sampling


GPU ising - https://github.com/NVIDIA/ising-gpu
CDT (causal dynamical triangulations) - 1+1
EDT (euclidean dynamical triangulations) - Tim Budd

Nested Sampling with Ising Model - then phi to the four - eventually gravity.
How does Schwinger model exhibit confinement?
